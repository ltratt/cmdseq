  Usage: cmdseq [-d <count dir>] <count1> <cmd1> [... <countn> <cmdn>]

cmdseq allows users to execute interleaved sequences of commands. Assuming the
same counts and commands, on each execution cmdseq executes one of the commands,
cycling through the sequence. For example, consider the following sequence:

  $ cmdseq 2 "echo cmd1" 1 "echo cmd2"
  cmd1
  $ cmdseq 2 "echo cmd1" 1 "echo cmd2"
  cmd1
  $ cmdseq 2 "echo cmd1" 1 "echo cmd2"
  cmd2
  $ cmdseq 2 "echo cmd1" 1 "echo cmd2"
  cmd 1
